# Ubiquitous Language - AVB/TSN Domain Terminology

**Phase**: 02-Requirements  
**Standards**: ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018, IEEE 802.1AS-2020, IEEE 1588-2019, IEEE 802.1Q-2018  
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for AVB/TSN domain terminology used consistently across requirements, design, code, and communication.

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-08  
**Derived From**: Requirements Consistency Analysis (Section 3 - Terminology Consistency)

## 🎯 Purpose

The Ubiquitous Language is a shared vocabulary used by all team members (developers, domain experts, stakeholders) to ensure consistent understanding. Terms defined here MUST be used in:

- ✅ Requirements specifications (REQ-F, REQ-NF, StR issues)
- ✅ Architecture decisions (ADRs)
- ✅ Code (class names, method names, variables, comments)
- ✅ Tests (test names, acceptance criteria)
- ✅ Documentation (README, API docs)
- ✅ Conversations with domain experts (IEEE 802.1 standards authors, AVB engineers)

**DDD Integration**: This glossary drives Model-Driven Design - when terms change here, code must be refactored to match. The domain model in code should be a direct reflection of the language captured here.

**Terminology Consistency**: Per Requirements Consistency Analysis finding, 6 requirements (#2, #3, #5, #6, #7) incorrectly use "PTP" instead of "gPTP". This glossary establishes correct usage.

## 📚 Time Synchronization (gPTP Bounded Context)

### gPTP (generalized Precision Time Protocol)

**Context**: Time Synchronization, AVB/TSN Networking  
**Definition**: IEEE 802.1AS-2020 profile of IEEE 1588 PTP, specific to AVB/TSN applications, requiring <1µs synchronization accuracy.  
**Type**: Domain Service (protocol implementation)  
**Standard**: IEEE 802.1AS-2020  
**Synonyms**: IEEE 802.1AS, PTP for AVB (avoid using generic "PTP")  
**Relationships**:
- Specialization of: PTP (IEEE 1588)
- Uses: PHC (Precision Hardware Clock), BMCA (Best Master Clock Algorithm)
- Related: Grandmaster Clock, Slave Clock, Peer Delay  
**Examples**:
- ✅ Correct: "The driver provides gPTP hardware abstraction per IEEE 802.1AS-2020"
- ❌ Incorrect: "The driver implements PTP synchronization" (too generic)  
**Rules**:
- MUST use peer-to-peer delay mechanism (not end-to-end)
- MUST achieve <1µs synchronization accuracy
- MUST run on 802.1AS-capable network infrastructure  
**Code Mapping**: `GPTP_CONTEXT`, `gptp_domain`, `is_gptp_capable`  
**Traceability**: #28 (StR-GPTP-001), #51 (REQ-F-NAMING-001), #119 (REQ-F-GPTP-COMPAT-001)
**Examples**:
- Checking account with $1,500 balance
- Savings account with 2.5% interest rate
- Business account with $10,000 overdraft limit
**Business Rules**:
- Account balance cannot go below overdraft limit
- Each account has unique account number (immutable)
- Account status can be: Active, Suspended, Closed
- Only active accounts can process transactions
**Code Mapping**: `Account` class, `AccountRepository`, `AccountService`  
**Traceability**: #REQ-F-ACCOUNT-001, #REQ-NF-SECURITY-003  
**Examples**:
- Checking account with $1,500 balance
- Savings account with 2% interest rate

**Type**: Pattern  
**Relationships**:
- Contains: Entity (root), Entity (internal), Value Object
- Related: Aggregate Root, Bounded Context
**Business Rules**:
- All changes go through Aggregate Root
- External references by ID only

**Relationships**:
- Part of: Aggregate
- Contains: Value Objects
**Business Rules**:
- Equality based on ID only
- Must have immutable identity
- Can be mutable (state changes)
**Traceability**: Design pattern (see `04-design/patterns/ddd-tactical-patterns.md`)  
**Examples**:
- User (ID: user-123, email changes but ID stays same)
- Order (ID: order-456, status changes over time)

---

### Invoice

**Context**: Billing, Accounting  
**Definition**: A document requesting payment for goods or services provided, including line items, amounts, and due date.  
**Type**: Entity (has identity)  
**Synonyms**: Bill  
**Relationships**:
- Belongs to: Customer
- References: Order
- Contains: InvoiceLines (internal entities)
**Business Rules**:

## 🔄 Context-Specific Terms

Some terms have different meanings in different Bounded Contexts. Document these clearly:

### "Account" - Context Variations

| Context | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Banking** | Financial account with balance | Checking Account #1234 |
| **Authentication** | User login credentials | User account: alice@example.com |
| **Accounting** | General ledger account | Revenue Account #4000 |

**Resolution**: Use qualified names when crossing contexts:
- BankAccount (Banking)
- UserAccount (Authentication)
- LedgerAccount (Accounting)

---

### "User" - Context Variations

| Context | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Authentication** | Person with login credentials | Authenticated user |
| **Customer Management** | Person who purchases | Customer (prefer this term) |
| **Support** | Person receiving support | Support case assignee |

**Resolution**: Prefer specific terms:
- Use "User" only in Authentication context
- Use "Customer" in Sales/Support contexts
- Use "Operator" for admin/system users

## 🚨 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't use technical terms when domain term exists**:
- Bad: `DataAccessObject`, `EntityManager`
- Good: `Repository`, `Order`

❌ **Don't use abbreviations not agreed by domain experts**:
- Bad: `Cust`, `Ord`, `Inv`
- Good: `Customer`, `Order`, `Invoice`

❌ **Don't use same term for different concepts**:
- Bad: "User" for both Customer and AuthenticatedUser
- Good: "Customer" (Sales context), "User" (Auth context)

❌ **Don't create synonyms in code**:
- Bad: `Client`, `Customer`, `Purchaser` used interchangeably
- Good: Pick one canonical term (`Customer`) and use consistently

**Source File**: `devices\intel_i350_impl.c`

**Body**:
```markdown
## Description
Device-specific implementation for Intel I350 Ethernet Controller

**Source**: Reverse-engineered from `devices\intel_i350_impl.c`

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-F-DEV-I350-001: I350 Hardware Support

The driver shall provide device-specific support for Intel I350 controllers.

**Feature Support**:
- **PTP**: ✅ Supported
- **TAS**: ❌ Not Detected
- **CBS**: ❌ Not Detected
- **FRAME_PREEMPTION**: ✅ Supported
- **MDIO**: ✅ Supported


**Lifecycle Operations**:
- **Initialization**: ✅ Implemented
- **Cleanup**: ✅ Implemented

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: I350 detection and initialization
  Given system has Intel I350 adapter installed
  When driver loads
  Then adapter is detected as supported device
  And device-specific initialization completes successfully
  And feature capabilities are accurately reported

Scenario: Feature availability reporting
  Given I350 is initialized
  When user queries device capabilities
  Then accurate feature support is reported
  And unsupported features return clear error codes
```

## Implementation

**Current File**: `devices\intel_i350_impl.c`

**Operations Table**:
| Operation | Function | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Initialize | `init(device_t *dev)` | ✅ |
| Cleanup | `cleanup(device_t *dev)` | ✅ |
| PTP Init | `init_ptp(device_t *dev)` | ✅ |

## Validation Required

⚠️ **This requirement was reverse-engineered from code and needs validation:**
- [ ] Verify feature support on actual I350 hardware
- [ ] Test initialization sequence (success and failure paths)
- [ ] Validate cleanup prevents resource leaks
- [ ] Test on multiple I350 hardware variants
- [ ] Document any hardware-specific quirks discovered

## Traceability
- Traces to:  StR-HWAC-002 (Reliable Hardware Detection)
- **Depends on**: REQ-F-DEV-001 (Generic Device Discovery)
- **Verified by**: (TBD - create TEST issue for I350 hardware validation)

## Priority
priority:p1

- [ ] Test on all supported controllers (I210, I219, I225, I226)
- [ ] Add performance/stress testing scenarios
- [ ] Validate error code handling
- [ ] Add traceability comments linking to requirements

## Validation Required

- [ ] Run test on actual hardware
- [ ] Verify all assertions pass
- [ ] Document expected vs. actual results
- [ ] Link to requirement issues being verified

## Priority

1. **Device Access**: Opening device handle to `\\.\IntelAvbFilter`
2. **IOCTL Communication**: Sending IOCTL requests and validating responses
3. **Hardware Validation**: Register read/write operations

## Test Implementation

**Test File**: `tools\avb_test\tsn_hardware_activation_validation.c`

**Traceability**: Add to test file header:
```c
/**
 * TEST-TSN-HARDWARE-ACTIVATION-VALIDATION-001: tsn_hardware_activation_validation Test Suite
 * 
 * Verifies: (add requirement issue numbers)
 * - REQ-F-IOCTL-* (IOCTL handlers)
 * - REQ-F-DEV-* (Device-specific functionality)
 */
```

## Test Execution

**Build**:
```powershell
# Use existing build scripts from project
.\tools\vs_compile.ps1 -BuildCmd "cl /nologo /W4 /Zi tools\avb_test\tsn_hardware_activation_validation.c /Fe:tsn_hardware_activation_validation.exe"
```

**Run**:
```powershell
.\tsn_hardware_activation_validation.exe
```

**Expected Output**: (TBD - document expected success criteria)

## Coverage Gaps

⚠️ **Potential gaps to address:**
- [ ] Add negative test cases (invalid inputs, error paths)
- [ ] Test on all supported controllers (I210, I219, I225, I226)
- [ ] Add performance/stress testing scenarios
- [ ] Validate error code handling
- [ ] Add traceability comments linking to requirements

## Validation Required

- [ ] Run test on actual hardware
- [ ] Verify all assertions pass
- [ ] Document expected vs. actual results
- [ ] Link to requirement issues being verified

## Priority
priority:p1

```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Review Generated Issues
- Validate each requirement with project owner
- Verify requirements match stakeholder needs (see `01-stakeholder-requirements/STAKEHOLDER-REQUIREMENTS.md`)
- Add missing edge cases or scenarios

### 2. Create GitHub Issues
```bash
# Create all requirements at once (bulk creation)
cd issue-bodies
for file in req-*.md; do
  gh issue create --label "type:requirement:functional,phase:02-requirements,priority:p1" \
    --title "$(head -n1 $file | sed 's/## Description//')" \
    --body-file "$file"
done
```

### 3. Add Traceability to Code
- Add `Implements: #N (REQ-F-*)` comments to IOCTL handlers
- Add `Verifies: #N` comments to test files
- Link issues bidirectionally (parent/child relationships)

### 4. Validate on Hardware
- Run tests on all supported controllers (I210, I219, I225, I226)
- Document actual vs. expected behavior
- Update requirement status (Working / Experimental / Broken)

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **Not Authoritative**: These requirements are reverse-engineered from code and may not represent correct or intended behavior
2. **Validation Required**: All requirements must be validated with stakeholders before being treated as truth
3. **Hardware Testing**: Code analysis alone cannot prove features work on hardware
4. **Traceability**: Link all requirements to stakeholder requirements (StR-*) in Phase 01

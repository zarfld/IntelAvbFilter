# Intel AVB Filter Driver - TODO

**Last Updated**: March 2026 (build 345, driver v1.0.193.x, 2026-03-29)

## 🟢 Current Phase: Post-Validation — Filling Remaining Gaps

I226-LM hardware validation is substantially complete. The CI runner has 6×Intel I226-LM
adapters. The hardware-dependent suite (HardwareUnit + HardwareIntegration) covers 60+
tests. Remaining work is targeted gap-filling, CI hardening, and production sign-off.

## 🔴 Active Failures to Fix

### #269 — ETW Event Log (10P / **1F**)
- **Problem**: Driver does not emit Event ID 1 to Windows Event Log on initialization;
  ETW manifest not installed/registered.
- **Action**: Register ETW manifest at driver load; add `mc.exe`-generated header to driver
  build; add EventWrite call in `DriverEntry`; re-verify TC-ETW-001.
- **Issue**: [#269](https://github.com/zarfld/IntelAvbFilter/issues/269)

### #271 — S3 Sleep/Wake PHC Preservation (TC-S3-002: **unconfirmed**)
- **Problem**: Test triggered real S3 sleep during run; wake-up PHC preservation result
  unconfirmed. `FilterRestart` S3 PHC fix is coded (`AvbBringUpHardware` called to
  re-program TIMINCA/SYSTIML/TSAUXC/TSYNCRXCTL) but not yet verified on a controlled
  S3 cycle.
- **Action**: Re-run on a dedicated machine with WoL configured and a serial console for
  post-wake log capture.
- **Issue**: [#271](https://github.com/zarfld/IntelAvbFilter/issues/271)

## 🔵 Hardware-Gated — Waiting for Physical Equipment

These tests have written code but need specific hardware to run the critical test cases.

| Issue | Equipment Needed | Blocked Test Cases |
|-------|------------------|--------------------|
| [#177](https://github.com/zarfld/IntelAvbFilter/issues/177) | GPIO oscilloscope | TC-PTP-LAT-001 (event latency <500 ns end-to-end) |
| [#179](https://github.com/zarfld/IntelAvbFilter/issues/179) | 4-channel oscilloscope (e.g. MDO3000) | TC-LAT4-001/003/004 (per-channel jitter measurement) |

## 🔧 CI / Infrastructure Gaps

From **TEST-PLAN-NDIS-LWF-COVERAGE** (Pillar 1 — Static Analysis):

- [x] ~~Enable MSVC `/analyze` (PREfast) in CI~~ — ✅ **DONE** (`static-analysis-prefast` job in
  `ci-standards-compliance.yml`; `continue-on-error: true` phase-in until baseline = 0)
- [ ] Run SDV and commit DVL artifact — `test-evidence/dvl-*.xml` required before each release
- [x] ~~Wire CodeQL for main driver source~~ — ✅ **DONE** (`codeql-driver.yml` uses
  `microsoft/windows-driver-developer-supplemental-tools`)
- [ ] Commit SDV results to `test-evidence/sdv-results-*.xml`
- [ ] Remove `continue-on-error: true` from PREfast job once C6xxx baseline reaches zero

From **TEST-PLAN-NDIS-LWF-COVERAGE** (Pillar 2 — Lifecycle Coverage):

- [x] ~~Add missing statistics counters to `AVB_DRIVER_STATISTICS` struct~~ — ✅ **DONE**
  (all 7 fields: FilterAttach/Pause/Restart/Detach, OutstandingSend/ReceiveNBLs, PauseRestartGeneration)
- [x] ~~Write lifecycle smoke test~~ — ✅ **DONE** (`test_lifecycle_coverage.exe` built;
  added to `HardwareUnitTests` suite in `Run-Tests-CI.ps1` 2026-03-29)

## 🚀 Production Hardening

- [ ] WHQL / EV code-signing for production release (test-signed only today)
- [ ] INF + CAT package for GitHub Release v0.1
- [ ] Resolve #269 (ETW manifest) — blocks Event Viewer integration for end users
- [ ] Stress test sign-off (#229) — prerequisite for "stable" release tag

## ⛔ Explicitly NOT Planned

### Simulation / Fake Modes
- Will NOT add hardware simulation, fake timestamps, or stub implementations  
- **Reason**: No false advertising — production code paths use real hardware only

### Legacy Controller Support
- Will NOT support Intel 82574L (lacks AVB/TSN hardware features)
- Will NOT support non-Intel Ethernet controllers

### Out-of-Scope Protocol Stacks
- Will NOT implement LACP (802.1AX) — [#221](https://github.com/zarfld/IntelAvbFilter/issues/221)
- Will NOT implement TSO/RSS/LSO/checksum offload — [#220](https://github.com/zarfld/IntelAvbFilter/issues/220) (miniport features, not LWF)
- Will NOT implement AVTP framing (IEEE 1722) — LWF operates at control-plane only

### Alternative Architectures
- Will NOT implement as standalone miniport driver
- Will NOT implement as user-mode library  
- **Reason**: NDIS 6.30 lightweight filter is the correct architecture for this use case
